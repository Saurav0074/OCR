## A simple OCR for recognising lower-case and upper-case English alphabets

This is the OCR software we built as our B.Tech. 6th semester academic project.

The features used by us include: 
```markdown
1. **Zoning** : To analyze the densities of the points and some strokes in different regions of  the image by dividing it into four non-overlapping zones (_upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right_) and form the features.
2. **Crossings** : To count the number of transitions from background to foreground pixels along vertical and horizontal lines through the character image.
3. **Moments** : To make the process of recognizing an object in an image size translation and rotation independent.
4. **Intersections/Junctions in a character** : To count the number of open end points and junctions from thinned and scaled character image by divided into 16 segments, each of size 25 Ã— 25 pixels wide. For each segment, the number of open end points and junctions are calculated. _Intersection point is defined as a pixel point which has more than two neighboring pixels in 8-connectivity while an open end has exactly one neighbor pixel._

When combined, these result in a total of 67 features, where the **Junction points in a character** was found to be the most relevant while the **Moments** was the least. 
```

`/tempdata1` contains the trained images.
`/images` contains the input images to be tested upon.

### For training the data:
` python3 trainingDataSetMaker.py`
### To observe the output of the recognised image:
` python3 main1.py`
### To observe the accuracy:
` python3 main.py`
### Executing the bash script for a combined output of above two commands:
` ./ocr.sh "/path/to/input/image"`

All the code has been implemented on our own.
Highest accuracy achieved so far : _90% on Voting of classifiers_ and can further be increased by addition of more reliable features.
